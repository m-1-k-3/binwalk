/// fully valid CSMAN entry stream that decompresses to ~120MiB from a ~120KiB file. Without an
/// upper bound on the decompressed size, scanning it would allocate the entire payload in one
/// contiguous buffer, enabling memory-exhaustion denial of service.
///
/// With the size limit in place, decompression aborts and the file produces no signature match.
/// (This exercises the scan phase only, so no extraction/file writes occur even on regression.)
